Created to write down some of my project codes in Digital Circuit Analysis Cources.

Trying hard to complete all in VerilogHDL and English.

Commits would be made ASAP.

Always *think twice* before using my disgusting code.

DO NOT JUST MERELY BORROW MY CODES.


Some tips for VerilogHDL beginners:
---
- HDL is *not* Programming Language.
- Practice is the only standard for testing truth.
- Build different components of your system by discripting how they run.
- Organize those components into a system by discripting the architecture of your whole system. 

Steps of developing your own digital system:
---
- What's your target? What're inputs/outputs?
- Break the system in to componets.
- Figure out their ports and connections.
- Develop those parts.
- Debug.(testbench or with FPGAs)
- Finish and submit.

HAVE FUN AS A NEW BYR.
